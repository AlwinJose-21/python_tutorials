
Wikipedia[note 3] is a free-content online encyclopedia written and maintained
 by a community of volunteers, collectively known as Wikipedians, through open collaboration
  and using a wiki-based editing system called MediaWiki. Wikipedia is the largest
  and most-read reference work in history,[3][4] and has consistently
   been one of the 10 most popular websites.[5]
Founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger on January 15, 2001,
 it is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization.
Initially only available in English, editions in other languages were quickly developed.
Wikipedia's editions when combined, comprise more than 61 million articles,
attracting around 2 billion unique device visits per month and
more than 15 million edits per month (about 5.8 edits per second on average) as of July 2023.[6][7]
